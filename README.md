- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @trillaman
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in cybersecurity
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python by creating own projects but there are many more done beside that and many in progress

My book shelves covers topic from programming through operating systems to electronics (but there is much more other interesting stuff).
I really love finding old books which covers electronics and non-technical ones about hackers and their beginnings.
